Objective: We have chosen the dataset from shakespeare lecturenotes. Our ultimate goal is to genearte the 51th text for given sentence which has 50 words as seed text.

Outcome: We were able to build the models togenearte the 51th text for given sentence which has 50 words as seed text.This is can be useful when we are writing a mail or essay for bussiness and personal purpose.
